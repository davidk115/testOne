<p> The domestic dog (Canis lupus familiaris when considered a subspecies of the wolf or Canis familiaris when considered a distinct species) is a member of the genus 
Canis (canines), which forms part of the wolf-like canids, and is the most widely abundant terrestrial carnivore. The dog and the extant gray wolf are 
sister taxa as modern wolves are not closely related to the wolves that were first domesticated, which implies that the direct ancestor of the dog is 
extinct. The dog was the first species to be domesticated and has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes. </p>


<p>Berchtold explained that Riley hangs over the fence every morning to play with passers-by, with his owners even leaving a place mat on the fence so he won’t hurt himself.
He said: “Early September, my two good friends Tom and Nicole were getting married, so I spent a lot of time around their apartment. One morning, we were waiting outside of their 
place for the wedding-event of the day, and I saw Riley from a distance.“I obviously freaked out, because the sight of him was just strikingly cute. I didn’t even realise he had a 
ball in his mouth until I started filming him… It was quite obvious that he expected someone to lend him a hand, because he looked directly at me and waited there until someone came 
to his rescue.”The video was re-posted by popular dog critiquing Twitter account <span class="test">WeRateDogs</span>, who gave Riley a whopping score of 14 out of 10. &#169;
